## Overview

TinyBrain's memory system is designed to store any type of information your AI needs to remember. Each memory is automatically embedded, indexed, and made searchable.

---

## Memory Types

TinyBrain supports 4 core memory types:

### Episodic (Events & Experiences)
Store time-bound events, meetings, interactions, or experiences.

```typescript
await client.memories.create({
  content: "Had a product review meeting with the design team. Discussed new dashboard redesign.",
  type: "episodic",
  metadata: {
    date: "2025-10-28",
    participants: ["Sarah", "Mike", "Alex"],
    category: "meeting"
  }
});
```

### Procedural (How-to & Workflows)
Store processes, procedures, templates, or workflows.

```typescript
await client.memories.create({
  content: "To deploy: 1) Run tests 2) Build production 3) Push to main 4) Verify deployment",
  type: "procedural",
  metadata: {
    category: "deployment",
    domain: "engineering"
  }
});
```

### Semantic (Facts & Knowledge)
Store facts, definitions, concepts, or general knowledge.

```typescript
await client.memories.create({
  content: "Our company's mission: Make AI memory accessible to every developer.",
  type: "semantic",
  metadata: {
    category: "company_info",
    source: "website"
  }
});
```

### Identity (Preferences & Traits)
Store user preferences, personality traits, or behavioral patterns.

```typescript
await client.memories.create({
  content: "User prefers receiving updates via Slack rather than email.",
  type: "identity",
  metadata: {
    category: "preferences",
    userId: "user_123"
  }
});
```

## Importance Scoring

TinyBrain automatically calculates an importance score (0.0 to 1.0) for each memory using AI. You can also set it manually:

```typescript
await client.memories.create({
  content: "Signed $500K enterprise contract with Acme Corp",
  type: "episodic",
  importance: 0.95,  // Manually set high importance
  metadata: {
    deal_value: 500000,
    customer: "Acme Corp"
  }
});
```

**Importance affects:**
- Search result ranking
- Memory retention priority
- Intelligence insights visibility

---

## Metadata & Tags

Add structured metadata to make memories more searchable and filterable:

```typescript
await client.memories.create({
  content: "Q3 revenue exceeded target by 15%",
  type: "semantic",
  metadata: {
    quarter: "Q3",
    year: 2025,
    category: "finance",
    metric_type: "revenue",
    value: 1500000,
    tags: ["revenue", "metrics", "success"]
  }
});
```

**Pro Tip:** Use consistent metadata keys across similar memories for better filtering.

---

## Batch Creation

Create multiple memories at once for better performance:

```typescript
const memories = [
  { content: "First memory", type: "episodic" },
  { content: "Second memory", type: "semantic" },
  { content: "Third memory", type: "procedural" }
];

await client.memories.createBatch(memories);
```

---

## Automatic Embeddings

TinyBrain automatically generates embeddings for every memory using `text-embedding-3-large`. No manual embedding required!

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. Memory content is processed
2. AI generates a 3072-dimensional embedding vector
3. Vector is stored in Qdrant for fast semantic search
4. Memory metadata is stored in PostgreSQL

---

## Deduplication

TinyBrain automatically detects and prevents duplicate memories:

```typescript
// First memory
await client.memories.create({
  content: "Met with Sarah about Q4 planning"
});

// Duplicate (will be detected and flagged)
await client.memories.create({
  content: "Met with Sarah about Q4 planning"
});
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "mem_existing123",
    "isDuplicate": true,
    "message": "Similar memory already exists"
  }
}
```

## Memory Limits

| Tier | Monthly Memories | Storage |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Free | 1,000 | 5 MB |
| Pro | 100,000 | 1 GB |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Unlimited |

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Use descriptive, detailed content
- Include relevant metadata
- Choose appropriate memory types
- Use consistent formatting

### ❌ Don't:
- Store PII without encryption
- Create duplicate memories
- Use overly generic content
- Exceed content length limits (10KB per memory)
